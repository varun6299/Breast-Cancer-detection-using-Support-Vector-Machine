# Breast-Cancer-detection-using-Support-Vector-Machine
Kaggle Task

This is the notebook for the breast cancer detection model submitted for a Kaggle Task. For this task, a breast cancer detection model was created using  support vector machine. In order to pick the features for estimation, the greedy elimination method was used. The default model produced achieved an accuracy of approx 96%. Further tuning of the parameters of the model led to an improved accuracy of approx 98%
